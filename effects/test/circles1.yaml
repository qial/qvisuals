# This is a first test to start working out the effect api

# designed defines this as a DesignedEffect
# Designed effects use the effect API to build effects

# we need to define a sequencer and bpm (or default will be used)
sequencer: 
  # type defines which sequencer processes the rest of the values
  type: bpm
  bpm: 120

# Now we define the shapes this effect will use
# The shapes are affected by Movements and driven by the Sequencer
shapes:
  # Our first shape is a set of circles
