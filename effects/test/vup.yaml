# test/vup.yaml
# This is a first test for the v up effect in the api

# designed defines this as a DesignedEffect
# Designed effects use the effect API to build effects
type: designed

# Set default fill/stroke settings
defaults:
  # set background to black
  background: 0
  # set default shape fill color
  fill: 255
  # set shape line width
  strokeWidth: 1
  # set shape line color
  stroke: 255

# we need to define a sequencer and bpm (or default will be used)
sequencer: 
  # type defines which sequencer processes the rest of the values
  type: bpm
  # set the bpm
  bpm: 120
  # positive:true sets sequencer to output 0->1 instead of -1->1
  positive: true
  
# Now we define the shapes this effect will use
# The shapes are affected by Movements and driven by the Sequencer
shapes:
  # Our first shape is a set of Vs
  - type: set
    # number of shapes
    amount: 4
    # define shape
    shape: 
      # set as v shape
      type: v-up
      # set width of the v
      width: 60
    # list of parameters shown
    params:
      - name: offset 
        start: 360
        increment: 120
    # set movement for each shape
    movement: 
      # type 'constant' means it moves at a set rate
      type: sequencer
      # set the parameter to change
      param: offset
      # set rate is 30 pixels per beat (due to bpm sequencer)
      amplitude: -120
  # Add last v separately so it can fade out
  - type: v-up
    # define width
    width: 60
    # set the initial position above the set
    offset: 240
    # define the movements
    movement:
      # first define the upward movement
      - type: sequencer
        # set offset as param
        param: offset
        # set the rate of change
        amplitude: -120
      # Now we define the fadeout
      - type: sequencer
