# test/vup.yaml
# This is a first test for the v up effect in the api

# peffect defines this as a ProcessingEffect
type: peffect

# Set default fill/stroke settings
defaults:
  # set default shape fill color
  fill: 255
  # set shape line width
  strokeWidth: 2
  # set shape line color
  stroke: 255

# we need to define a sequencer and bpm (or default will be used)
sequencer: 
  # type defines which sequencer processes the rest of the values
  type: bpmhttp://i.imgur.com/0akDEeh.png
  # set the bpm
  bpm: 120
  # positive:true sets sequencer to output 0->1 instead of -1->1
  positive: true
  
# Now we define the shapes this effect will use
# The shapes are affected by Movements and driven by the Sequencer
shapes:
  # Our first shape is a set of Vs
  - type: set
    # distance between shapes in the set 
    increment: 120
    # define shape
    shape: 
      # set as v shape
      type: v
      # set width of the v
      width: 60
    # set movement for each shape
    movement: 
      # type 'constant' means it moves at a set rate
      type: constant
      # set rate is 30 pixels per beat (due to bpm sequencer)
      amplitude: 30
